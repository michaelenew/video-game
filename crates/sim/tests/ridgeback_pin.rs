//! The Ridgeback, pinned bit for bit.
//!
//! When the creature code became species-generic (see
//! `docs/design/species.md`), the promise was that the Ridgeback came out of it
//! **bit-identical**: the same seeds, the same frames, the same numbers. This
//! is the check that keeps it so. A hunt driven by a fixed stream of inputs is
//! hashed every frame with `World::state_checksum` -- the snapshot, with the
//! Oven left out, because where a knob is stored is not the fight -- and the
//! running hash is compared against the one the code produced before the move.
//!
//! **If this fails after a change that was meant to change the Ridgeback**, it
//! is doing its job: re-pin it, and say in the commit and in
//! `docs/design/feel-log.md` what moved and why. If it fails after a change
//! that was not meant to touch the Ridgeback, the change is wrong.
