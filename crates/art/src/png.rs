//! A PNG writer, in about a hundred lines and with no dependencies.
//!
//! Here so that materials can be *looked at* without launching the game.
//! Numbers say whether stone is anisotropic; they do not say whether it looks
//! like stone, and the gap between those two is where every procedural
//! material goes wrong.
//!
//! Deliberately uncompressed. PNG's container requires a zlib stream, but zlib
//! streams are allowed to consist entirely of **stored** blocks — literal
//! bytes with a length header — so a conforming file needs no compressor at
//! all. The result is a few times larger than it has to be and is opened
//! without complaint by everything, which is the whole requirement for a
//! preview sheet. Pulling in an image crate to save maybe 300 KB of a file
//! nobody keeps would be the wrong trade for a crate whose zero dependencies
//! are the point.
